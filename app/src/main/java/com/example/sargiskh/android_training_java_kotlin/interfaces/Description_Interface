* An interface is a collection of abstract methods. It is a reference type in Java/Kotlin.
  It is similar to class. A class implements an interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface.
* Along with abstract methods, an interface may also contain constants, default methods, static methods, and nested types.
  Method bodies exist only for default methods and static methods.


Interfaces have the following properties:
* An interface is implicitly abstract. You do not need to use the abstract keyword while declaring an interface.
* Each method in an interface is also implicitly abstract, so the abstract keyword is not needed.
* Methods in an interface are implicitly public.


An interface is similar to a class in the following ways:
* An interface can contain any number of methods.
* An interface is written in a file with a .java  or .kt (for kotlin)  extension, with the name of the interface matching the name of the file.
* The byte code of an interface appears in a .class file.
* Interfaces appear in packages, and their corresponding bytecode file must be in a directory structure that matches the package name.

An interface is different from a class in several ways, including:
* You cannot instantiate an interface.
* An interface does not contain any constructors.
* All of the methods in an interface are abstract.
* An interface cannot contain instance fields. The only fields that can appear in an interface must be declared both static and final.
* An interface is not extended by a class; it is implemented by a class.
* An interface can extend multiple interfaces.
