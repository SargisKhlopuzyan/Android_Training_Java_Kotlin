AsyncTaskLoader is a subclass of Loader, unlike AsyncTaskâ€™s,
AsyncTaskLoader prevent duplication of background threads and eliminate duplication of zombie (dead or destroyed) activities.

There are mainly two types of loaders: AsyncTaskLoader and CursorLoader.

Why Use Loaders?
* Loaders run on separate threads to prevent unresponsive UI.
* Loaders simplify thread management by providing callback methods when events occur.
* Loaders persist and cache results across configuration changes to prevent duplicate queries.
* Loaders can implement an observer to monitor for changes in the underlying data source.
  For example, CursorLoader automatically registers a ContentObserver to trigger a reload when data changes.
